# DSAP: A Dynamic Sparse Attention Perception Matcher for Accurate Local Feature Matching
This is the PyTorch implementation of our paper "DSAP: A Dynamic Sparse Attention Perception Matcher for Accurate Local Feature Matching".

We appreciate the previous open-source repository [LoFTR](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR). Our work is built upon it.

# Demo
We provide a demo to directly visualize the matching results of DSAP
