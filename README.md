# DSAP: A Dynamic Sparse Attention Perception Matcher for Accurate Local Feature Matching
This is the PyTorch implementation of our paper "DSAP: A Dynamic Sparse Attention Perception Matcher for Accurate Local Feature Matching".

We appreciate the previous open-source repository [LoFTR](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR). Our work is built upon it.

# Quick Demo
![demo_img](https://github.com/mooncake199809/DSAP/blob/main/demo/img_res.jpg)
We provide a demo to directly visualize the matching results of DSAP.
You can directly modify your images path to test your own images.
```bash
python demo_dsap.py
```
